# Ntree
**Your little digital tree.**

### Every tree can have:
 - a trunk 
 - top branches (branches coming out of the top of the trunk)
 - side top branches (branches coming out of other top branches)
 - tree tops
 - trunk branches (brunches coming out of the side of a trunk)

## TODO
 - changing colors of the trunk from green to brown
 - random appearing trunk branches
 - fix connection between tree tops and trunk
